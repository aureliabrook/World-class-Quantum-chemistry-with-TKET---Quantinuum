  Nick is entering his third year at New York University studying Physics and Math, and Aurelia just completed her undergraduate degrees in Physics and Math from the same university. While both have performed research in quantum computing before, this was their first time working with variational methods and learning how to use 'TKET'. This project was chosen as a learning opportunity, but also because the task posed had important applications in the real world. As the climate crisis accelerates, investigating renewable energy sources becomes more pertinent to scientists of all disciplines. LiH is commonly used as fuel for its high hydrogen content (such as in the posted problem, where LiH is used in electric vehicles), and can be a shield for nuclear reactors. An issue many encounter with LiH is its potential for violent reactions when exposed to water, and the dissipation of energy from lithium batteries. Figuring out how quantum computers can aid in the research of LiH is an important step in improving the technology that allows us to utilize renewable energy sources.

#### Pitch Competition
A more digestible version of our hack will be presented at the Pitch Competition on August 25, 2022, with slides to be posted after the competition. 

#### Code Submission
All levels of the problem were answered, and were labeled according to the titles given in the problem prompt. Each submission is in the form of a python notebook so one does not need to run each of the cells individually in order to see the results we got. Results were left in the cells. A separate folder with the coupling maps and details of the chips used is also provided so onlookers can have an easier time accessing information about the chips we used.
##### Note: Aurelia's IBM account was used to access quantum chips, so her API was manually deleted before upload of the code. If someone wanted to run the code on their own without any modifications, they'd need their own account and access to the same chips we used.
